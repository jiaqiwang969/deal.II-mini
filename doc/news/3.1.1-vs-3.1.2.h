       The only is change is that the configuration detects the
       presence of gcc3.0 and works around a bug in it by compiling
       the file <code>tria_accessor.cc(3d)</code> without optimization
       flags even for optimized libraries. The gcc bug is documented
       at the <a
       href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?database=gcc&user=guest&password=guest&cmd=login"
       target="_top">gcc bug tracking system page</a>, as bugs reports c++/615 and
       optimization/2938.
